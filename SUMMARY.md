**DeepFish Dataset** is a dataset for instance segmentation, classification, semantic segmentation, object detection, counting, and localization tasks. It is used in the environmental research, and in the fishery industry. 

The dataset consists of 43586 images with 374 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*fish*).

Images in the DeepFish dataset have pixel-level instance segmentation annotations. Due to the nature of the instance segmentation task, it can be automatically transformed into a semantic segmentation (only one mask for every class) or object detection (bounding boxes for every object) tasks. There are 43276 (99% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 9 splits in the dataset: *classification test* (19884 images), *classification train* (15906 images), *classification val* (3976 images), *localization train* (1600 images), *localization test* (960 images), *localization val* (640 images), *segmentation train* (310 images), *segmentation test* (186 images), and *segmentation val* (124 images). Alternatively, the dataset could be split into 20 habitats: ***low complexity reef*** (5411 images), ***sandy mangrove prop roots*** (4526 images), ***complex reef*** (4224 images), ***seagrass bed*** (3599 images), ***low algal bed*** (3094 images), ***reef trench*** (2888 images), ***boulders*** (2557 images), ***rocky mangrove - prop roots*** (2357 images), ***mixed substratum mangrove - prop roots*** (2344 images), ***upper mangrove - medium rhizophora*** (2251 images), ***rock shelf*** (2053 images), ***mangrove - mixed pneumatophore prop root*** (1732 images), ***sparse algal bed*** (1467 images), ***muddy mangrove - pneumatophores and trunk*** (1309 images), ***large boulder and pneumatophores*** (1028 images), ***rocky mangrove - large boulder and trunk*** (645 images), ***bare substratum*** (613 images), ***upper mangrove - tall rhizophora*** (552 images), ***large boulder*** (506 images), and ***muddy mangrove - pneumatophores*** (430 images). Additionally, some images marked with ***no fish*** and ***fish count*** tags.
